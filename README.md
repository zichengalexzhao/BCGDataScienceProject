# [BCG - Data Science Project](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/bcg/data-science-ccdz)
## Project Background
- PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.  
- The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.  
- PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, which is called churn.  
- This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

## Procedure
### Step 1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Here are 3 data sets:
1. [Historical customer data](BCGDataScienceProject/Datasets/client_data (1)): Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc.
2. Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc.
3. Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not.

Analyze the following using Python:
1. The data types of each column.
2. Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
3. Distributions of columns.

### Step 2. Feature Engineering

### Step 3. Predict Churn
Use Random Forest Regression Model to predict churn rate

### Step 4. Data Interpretation

According to the modelling and analysis, make data interpretation that makes a business impact
